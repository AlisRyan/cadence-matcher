# cadence-matcher

Created a website using React and the Spotify API so that you can cater 
        your playlists to your running cadence. 
        It's been shown that running with music at a faster
        tempo not only encourages you to run faster, but also
        prevent injury. This website allows you to also be able to customize the level of
        danceability and energy that you want all the songs to be at 
        to form your custom running playlist. 


**Currently under construction: All functionality is completed but it's frontend design is unfinished**
