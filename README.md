### How do I run it?

First, fork and clone the repo, and then set up a Spotify Developer Account [here](https://developer.spotify.com). Then, create a new application, and take the client id from that application and replace the placeholder on line 16 of `src/SpotifyApp.js` with your new client id. Then run `npm start` and you are good to go!

### How do I use it?
Once you sign in with your Spotify account, you'll be shown all of your playlists, and you can select the ones that you want tracks drawn from to make your new running playlist. Then, use the sliders to customize the tracks that will be added, so that their tempo and energy fit your running mood best. This way, all run you'll be listening to music that not only you enjoy because it came from your playlists, but it'll be perfectly curated to your running needs. MFinally, continue on and enter a playlist name and privacy settings, and we'll add the playlist straight to your library!
